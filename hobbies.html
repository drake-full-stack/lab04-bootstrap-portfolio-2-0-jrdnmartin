    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>Two of my favorite hobbies are <em>playing video games</em> and <em>watching soccer</em>.</p>
    <h2>Video Games</h2>
    <p>I enjoy playing a variety of video games, including roguelikes, story games, and simulators.</p>
    <p>I'm also big into <strong>100%ing</strong> games, which means completing every achievement that a game has to offer.</p>

    <h2>Soccer</h2>
    <p>My favorite soccer team is <strong>Arsenal</strong>.</p>
    <p>I've been a fan of Arsenal for many years and tune in to their matches whenever I can.</p>
    <p>They play in the <strong>Premier League</strong> (England's top tier of professional soccer), which means that timezones can often make it difficult.</p>
